                    she was the creative I needed to share. This piece also appears in the

                <p>When a friend of mine announced she was starting a music blog, I asked if I could write a style guide for her and her writers. I took on the task so I could get some experience with editorial styling. After researching a few other style guides, including an old one from VICE magazine, I put together the beginnings of Groupie's style guide for writers. As the project gets off the ground, this guide is intended to keep non-traditional music writers on track— an anchor for DIY creatives just trying to express their visions.</p>

                <p>My work during the 2017 NEH Institute taught me the basics of the UNIX command line, but it was more a trial-by-fire situation than a workshop one.
